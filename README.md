# Wasteland-Sheriff
Turn based combat game based in a wasteland-western setting

    The Beams quiver and Ka turns like the wheel it is. The last in the line of the Eld walks the wastes with two sigul
strapped upon his hips. Meanwhile, the town of Tull is tired and weak after being ravaged by the horrors of the wastes.
Uncover the dark past of Tull as the new Sheriff and protect your constituents. Also, never kill with your gun, for he
who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
